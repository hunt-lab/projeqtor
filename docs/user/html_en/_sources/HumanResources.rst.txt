   `French documentation <https://www.projeqtor.org/files/ProjeQtOr%20-%20Documentation%20-%20Absences%20r%C3%A9glement%C3%A9es.pdf>`_ on the implementation of regulated absences is available on the `download page <https://www.projeqtor.org/fr/product-fr/downloads-fr/>`_

This section allows to manage the society's Humans Resources 

This system comes in addition to the standards of the management of absences

* You must define the :ref:`employee_manager`, :ref:`Leaves_Types` and :ref:`employment_contract_type` 

* You can choose the leave entitlement standard for each type of contract

* The employee may reserve periods of leave of absence according to his rights.

* The system also includes a validation process of the requests during the leave period.


.. warning:: **Absence Administrator**

   In order to be able to manage and parameterize the human resources module after its installation, 
   you must go to global parameters in the Work tab.
   A new parameter is displayed: Leaves System

Regulated absence
-----------------

The "Regulated Absence" module is used to manage absences that must be validated, controlled and have values to be regulated according to French law.

Thanks to this module, it is thus possible to manage the paid holidays, the RTT, the Stopped diseases by treating

   * quantities acquired over a period of time
   * the period of validity of a quantity of absence 
   * the possibility or not to take early holidays over the period being acquired
   * the number of days before and after which the absence request can be made
   * specific acquisition rules
   * validation or rejection of an application
   
.. note:: A project dedicated to these regulated absences is created and makes it possible to store the requested days of absence as planned time 
   and the days of absence validated as working time thus making it possible to integrate these absences in the planning.   

.. rubric:: Leaves States   

Regulated absences have 3 states:

   .. compound:: recorded

      Creation status. In this state all the data of the absence can be modified

   .. compound:: validated

      State that only the manager and the administrator of the module can be enabled.
      
      In this state, only the state of absence can be changed by the manager or administrator

   .. compound:: cancelled

      State that only the manager and the administrator of the module can be enabled.
      
      In this state, only the state of absence can be modified by the manager or administrator
      
      and the number of days the absence represents are not taken


.. note:: 

   The calculation of the number of days represented by absence is done on the basis of working days
   :ref:`global_parameters` and schedule associated with employee: holidays, non-working days

         This section is visible and linked to the :ref:`employment_contract_type` screen
   
         To an employee are associated a :ref:`employment_contract` and :ref:`leaves_rights_earned` 
         
         The contract is associated with a :ref:`employment_contract_type` 
         
         This allow the employee to associate the rules of acquisition, the special rules of regulated absences and the acquired rights by type of absence and by acquisition period.





.. rubric:: Manager

A manager is a resource whose properties **"is an employee"** and **"is absence manager"** are checked

   :alt: Manager is a resource and the manager of leaves
   :align: center
   :scale: 70%
   
   Box **"is an employee"** and **"is manager of leaves"** is checked

A manager must be an employee.

An employee manager can make absence requests in lieu of employees.

He can validate or reject employee absentee requests that he manages.

.. important:: 

   The management of an employee is dated, which allows to change manager 
   
   or temporarily delegate management to another manager (absences).

.. rubric:: Bulk add for employees managed

It is possible here to associate the employees with their manager, ie:

* **IN MASS** according to criteria of massification

* **UNITAIREMENT** with the list of employees attached to this manager
 

For example, if the company closes in August ...

The manager can register a request for his organization and under organization, for all the organizations, his entire team,
himself included



.. rubric:: Administrator

If an employee does not have a manager, the administrator of the Regulated absence module acts as manager.

The administrator is obligatorily a leave manager

Earned rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The regulation of absences is based on the rights to take absences acquired over a given period.

It is therefore based on values to be given to attributes of regulation according to the type of absence (ex: Paid leave, RTT, sick leave, legal leave, etc.), and the type of contract associated with the employee (Ex: Full time, Part time).


.. rubric:: General acquisition of rights

When you create a :ref:`employment_contract_type` or :ref:`Leaves_Types`, you have several contractual values to fill in.

.. warning:: Check box **"On default"** and **"on everything"**

   * If you check on **"default"** the entered values will be reflected on the default contract type only. 

   * If you check on **"all"** the entered values will be on all contract types. 

   * These values can not be changed after they are saved.

   For any change, the creation of a new type of absence is necessary.
