Project
*******

A project is the main entity of ProjeQtOr.

Project element is more than a :ref:`planning-element`.


.. rubric:: Gather all project data

It is also used to allows to gather all data depend on project:

 * Planning element
 * Risk assessment, Risk mitigation, Reserve
 * Ticket, Issue, Bug tracking, Change request, Support
 * Steering, Meeting, Decision, Action plan
 * Requirement & Test 
 * Project expense
 * Quotation, Order, Bill, Payment
 * Document


.. rubric:: Restrict data visibility
   
Allows restricting data visibility to users by project.
   
The project data visibility is granted according to the user profile.
   
   
.. seealso:: 
      
   :ref:`profiles-definition` and :ref:`allocation-to-project`


.. compound:: **Project selector**
      
   The project selector works as a filter.
          
   By default, the selector displays "all projects", you can change this view in the user-miscelleanous settings and choose the project to display by default
          
   You can restrict data for one or more dedicated projects without necessarily being bound

.. _project_type_definition:

The project type
----------------

.. compound:: Three project types can be defined:
   
      **1 - Operational project**
                     
         Most common project to follow activity.
                        
         Manual Billed, Fixed price, Capped time, Time & materials, Internal are operationals projects
                  
         .. image:: /images/GUI/CONCEPT_ZONE_ProjectType.png
            :align: center
                  
      **2 - Administrative project**
                  
         Allows to follow the non productive work as holidays, sickness, training, …
                        
         All resources have access to this project type without being assigned (project) or assigned (Activity).
                        
         Create an activity, like an OPE project, for each type of absence.
                     
      **3 - Template project**
                  
         Designed to define templates, to be copied as operational project.
                        
         Any project manager can copy these projects without having to be assigned to them. On the other hand they will not be able to modify it and will have to copy the project in OPE for that.

         For modifying a template project, the modifier must be assigned to the project..
   
         See: :ref:`Copy an item<copy-item>`
         
.. note:: 

   The project type is defined in a project type.
   
   Which is associated to a project. See: :ref:`planningelem_project`
   
   
   

.. rubric:: Define billable project

A project can be billable or not.

 .. compound:: **Non billable project**

    The non billable project is used for internal or administrative project.

 .. compound:: **Billable project**

    For billable projects the billing types available are: at terms, on producing work, on capping produced work and manual.
    
    The actual work done and billed is locked

.. note:: 

   The project billing type is defined in a project type.
   
   Which is associated to a project. See: :ref:`planningelem_project`

   * You can select resource or contact.
   * If none is selected then the user connected is used to define the allocation.
   * If a contact is a resource and inversely, then resource or contact name will be selected too.


The following sections describe allocation to project, performed for user, resource or contact.

User allocation
---------------

Allocation to project gives data visibility on a project.

Allocation to project can be defined in the :ref:`user` screen.

.. rubric:: Profile selection

Selected profile allows to define access rights on project elements.

.. tip::

   Selected profile allows to define the role played by the user in a project.
   
   For instance, the user might be a project manager in a project and it could be a project member in another. 
   
   
.. note:: 

   Profile defined in allocation to project does not grant or revoke access to users.
      
   General access to application functionalities and data is defined by user profile. 

.. rubric:: Period selection

Allow to define the period of project data visibility.

.. tip::
 
     Can be used to limit access period, according to services agreement.

    \newpage

.. _resource-allocation-to-project:

Resource allocation to project
------------------------------

Allocation to project allows to define the resource availability on project.

A resource may be allocated to projects at a specified rate for a period.

Allocation to project can be defined in :ref:`planningelem_project` and :ref:`resource` screens.

It is also possible to allocate a team to a project in :ref:`team` screens.

.. note::

   A resource allocated to a project can be defined as :term:`responsible` of project items treatment.


.. rubric:: Period & Rate selection

A resource may be allocated to a project at a specified rate for a period. 

.. note::

   If the period is not specified then the resource is allocated throughout the project.

.. warning::

    The planning calculator tries to plan, the remaining work on the task assigned to a resource within the allocation to project period.
    
    If remaining work on the task can't be planned, a purple bar appears in the Gantt view.

.. rubric:: Change resource on an allocation to project

A resource can be changed on allocation to project.

All tasks assigned to old resource will be transferred to the new resource with planned work and remaining work.

Work done on tasks belongs to always the old resource.


Multi-allocation to project
---------------------------

A resource can be allocated to multiple projects in the same period.

Make sure that the allocation to projects for a period not exceeding 100%.

In the section **Allocations** in :ref:`resource` screen, a tool allows to displayed conflicts.

.. tip:: How resolve conflicts?

   You can change allocation period to avoid overlap between projects.
   
   You can change the rate of allocation for it does not exceed 100% for the period.


Contact allocation to project
-----------------------------

A contact allocated to a project can be defined as :term:`requestor`.

Allocation to project can be defined in :ref:`planningelem_project` and :ref:`contact` screens.



.. _concept_activity:

Activity
********

An activity is a kind of task that can be planned or that groups other activities.

This is usually a long-term task that can be assigned to one or more resources. 

Activities will appear on the Gantt schedule view.

For example, you might consider an activity:

* Scheduled tasks,
* Modification requests,
* The phases,
* Versions or new deployments,

Activities can be grouped as a Mother / Daughter link. 

The parent activity must belong to the same project. 

A WBS structure is applied and a dynamic index is calculated for all activities. 

The WBS Activity Index can be changed in the Gantt schedule view using drag and drop.

.. _assignment:

Assignment
----------

The assignment is used to assign resources to project tasks (activity, test session, meeting).

Consists to assign a resource to a task in a specific function. The function allows to define the resource daily cost.

A resource assignment contains data about work on task (planned, real, left and reassessed work).

You can not remove a resource assignment once the resource has entered real work on the activity.

Similarly, if the resource has completed its activity, deletion is not possible. 

You keep track of the resources that have been assigned and worked on the activity.
    
.. note::

   Only resources allocated by the project can be assigned to project tasks.

   Assignment can be done in :ref:`activity`, :ref:`test-session` and :ref:`meeting` screens.

.. _product-concept:

Product
*******

A product is a material object or for IT/IS projects is a software application.

.. rubric:: Composition of product

A product can have a complex structure that can be composed of sub-product and components.

A product and its components can have several versions that represent each declination.

See: :ref:`product-structure`

.. rubric:: Linked to a project

A product is an element delivered by a project.

The link with the project have no impact on project planning.

Indicates only that project is devoted to a specific product versions.

The link management is done in :ref:`planningelem_project` and :ref:`product-version` screens.

Product (component) versions can be identified in these elements:

* :ref:`activity`
* :ref:`milestone`
* :ref:`requirement`
* :ref:`test-case`
* :ref:`test-session` 
* :ref:`ticket`.
  
The purpose is to identify which product (component) and its version that is the subject of the treatment.

Depending on the element, it has the possibility identifying version of  origin, target version or both.

.. rubric:: Document management

Documents can be identified to products.

See: :ref:`document`

.. rubric:: Management of product and component elements 

See: :ref:`ConfigurationManagement`, for detail about management of product and component elements.

.. index:: Planning

.. _planning:


Planning
********

ProjeQtOr implements work-driven planning method.

Based upon on resource availability and their capacity.

.. rubric:: Resource availability

Resource availability is defined by calendars and project allocation period.

 .. compound:: **Resource calendar**

    * Each resource is attached to a calendar to define its working days.
    * Tasks assigned to the resource will be planned according to working days defined in the calendar.
    * More detail, see: :ref:`resource-calendar`

 .. compound:: **Project allocation period**

    * The resource can be allocated to several projects.
    * Possibility to define allocation period.
    * More detail, see: :ref:`resource-allocation-to-project`

.. rubric:: Resource capacity

Resource capacity is defined on daily base.

The scheduling tool does not exceed the daily resource capacity.

.. note:: Full Time Equivalent (FTE)
 
   * This indicator is defined for each resource.   
   * It allows to define the daily capacity.
   * More detail, see: :ref:`resource`

.. rubric:: Project allocation rate

The project allocation rate is used to resolve allocation conflicts between projects.

It allows to define resource availability for a project during a period.

Use with the resource capacity, it allows to define the project allocation capacity on a weekly base.

.. rubric:: Task assignation rate

The task assignation rate is used to keep some scheduling time for other tasks.

Use with the resource capacity, it allows to define the assignation capacity on a daily base.

Draft planning
--------------

Two methods can be used to create a draft planning.

.. rubric:: Use planning mode "fixed duration"

This planning mode is used to define fixed duration tasks. See: :ref:`planningMode`

Dependencies allow to define the execution order of tasks. See: :ref:`dependencies`

You can define this planning mode as defaut in the Activities Types screen for some types of activities you'll use in draft plannings

.. rubric:: Use faked and team resource

The faked and team resource can be useful to get a first estimate of project cost and duration without involving the real resources.

Planning schedule is calculated using of the work-driven planning method.

Faked and team resources can be mixed in same draft planning.

     .. compound:: **Faked resources**

        * For instance, you want to define a Java developer resource. You can create a resource named "Java developer #1".
        * There are several levels of Java developer with different daily costs (beginner, intermediary and expert).
        * You can define for this resource the functions and average daily cost for each level. (See: :ref:`resource-function-cost`)
        * You assign this resource to tasks, to a specific function (level). (See: :ref:`assignment`)
        * Faked resource will be easily replaced with *real* resources when project becomes real, with *allocation replacement* feature. 

     .. compound:: **Team resource**

        * A team resource is a resource whose daily capacity has been defined to represent capacity of a team (Capacity (FTE) > 1).
        * For instance, you needed to define four Java developers, but you don’t want to create a resource for each. You can *overload* the daily capacity of the resource (Example: Capacity FTE=4).
        * Using team resources is very easy but renders estimation of project duration as draft, not taking into account constraint of different resources such as possibly different skills or expertise level.
        * With team resources it is very easy to estimate planning with different number of members in the team : what if I include 5 Java develpers instead of 4 ? Just change capacity to 5 and re-calculate planning...

.. index:: Planning elements (Concept)

.. _planning-element:

Planning elements
-----------------

ProjeQtOr offers standard planning elements like Project, Activity and Milestone.

But also, it offers two more planning element: Test session and Meeting.

.. rubric:: Project

This planning element defines the project.

* It allows to specify information on the project sheet like the customer, bill contact, sponsor, manager and objectives.
* Documents, notes and attachments can be annexed.
* More detail: :ref:`planningelem_project`

   .. compound:: **Sub-project**
   
       Sub-project is used to split the project.
       
       The project can be split to correspond the organizational breakdown or something else.

     .. note::
     
      **Separation of duties**

        * A project can be split into multiple sub projects.
        * A project leader and team can be allocated to each sub-project. 
        * Project allocation allows to define data visibility and isolate sub-projects. See: :ref:`allocation-to-project`
        * A supervisor can follow-up the project in its totality. 

        .. figure:: /images/GUI/CONCEPT_SCHEMA_SeparationDuties.png
           :alt: Separation of duties
           :align: center

           Separation of duties

.. rubric:: Activity

This planning element can be a phase, a delivery, a task or any other activity.

An activity can grouped other activities or be a task.

More detail, see: :ref:`activity` screen

 .. compound:: **Grouping of activities**

    * An activity can be the parent of activities.
    * This allows to define the structure of phases and deliveries.
    * Dates, works and costs of activities (child) are summarized in the activity (parent).

 .. compound:: **Task**
 
    * An activity is a task when it's not a parent of activities.
    * A task is assigned to resources for to be performed.



.. rubric:: Test session

This planning element is a specialized activity aimed for tests.

A test session allows to define a set of test case that must be run.

A test session can grouped other test sessions or be a task.

More detail, see: :ref:`test-session` screen.

 .. compound:: **Grouping of test sessions**

    * A test session can be the parent of test sessions.
    * This allows to define the structure of test sessions.
    * Dates, works and costs of test sessions (child) are summarized in the test session (parent).

 .. compound:: **Task**

    * A test session is a task when it's not a parent of test sessions.
    * A task is assigned to resources for to be performed.

.. rubric:: Milestone

This planning element is a flag in the planning, to point out key dates.

May be a transition point between phases, deliveries.

ProjeQtOr offers two types of milestone floating and fixed.

More detail, see: :ref:`milestone` screen.

.. _concept_meeting:

.. rubric:: Meeting

This planning element acts like a fixed milestone, but it's a task.

Like a milestone, a meeting can be a transition point. 

But also, like a task because it's possible to assign resources and planned work.

More detail, see: :ref:`meeting` screen.

.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. _dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

Dependencies allow to define the execution order of tasks (sequential or concurrent).

All planning elements can be linked to others.

Dependencies can be managed in the Gantt chart and in screen of planning element.

More detail, see: :ref:`project-planning`, :ref:`predSuces-element-section`.

.. note:: 

   **Global parameter "Apply strict mode for dependencies"**

   If the value is set to “Yes”, the planning element (successor) can't start the same day that the end date of planning element (predecessor). 

.. rubric:: Delay (days)

A delay can be defined between predecessor and successor (start).


.. topic:: Dependency types

   * ProjeQtOr offers only the dependency (Finish to Start).
   * This section explains what are they dependency types can be reproduced or not.

    .. compound:: |iconSS| **Start to Start**

       To reproduce this dependency type, it's possible to add a milestone as prior of both tasks.

    .. compound:: |iconES| **Start to Finish** 

       This dependency type can't be reproduced in ProjeQtOr.
       
       This is a very weird scenario.

    .. compound:: |iconEE| **Finish to Finish**

       This dependency type can't be reproduced in ProjeQtOr.
       
       This involves reverse planning and may introduce overloading of resources, what is not possible in ProjeQtOr.


.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. _planningMode:

Planning mode
-------------

Planning mode allows to define constraints on planning elements: activity, test session and milestone.

.. rubric:: Milestones planning mode

Planning modes are grouped under two types for milestone :

 .. compound:: Floating

   * These planning modes have no constraint date.
   * Planning element is floating depending on its predecessors.
   * Planning modes: As soon as possible, Work together, Fixed duration and floating milestone.


 .. compound:: Fixed
   
   * These planning modes have constraint date.
   * Planning modes: Must not start before validated date, As late as possible, Regular and fixed milestone.

.. seealso:: 

   :ref:`Activity and Test session  planning modes<progress-section-planning-mode>` and :ref:`Milestone planning modes<planning-mode-milestone>`.

.. note:: 

   Because ProjeQtOr does not backward planning, the planning mode "As late as possible" with no constraint date  (Floating) is not available.

   **Default planning mode**

   Possibility to define the default planning mode according to element type.
   
   See: :ref:`activity-type`, :ref:`milestone-type` and :ref:`test-session-type` screens. 

.. rubric:: Planning element planning mode

several planning modes for your project elements are proposed to best manage the time spent on certain planning elements

* As soon as possible
* Work together
* Fixed duration
* Must not start before validated start date
* Should end before validated end date
* Regular between dates
* Regular in full days
* Regular in half days
* Regular in quarter days
* Recurry (on weekly basis)

 .. compound:: Prioritized planning elements

   Planning elements are scheduled in this order of priority:
   
   #. Fixed date (Fixed milestone, Meeting)
   #. Recurrent activities - Planning modes "Regular..." (Activity, Test session)
   #. Fixed duration (Activity, Test session)
   #. Others


.. _minimum-threshold:

minimum threshold & not splitted work
-------------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/GUI/CONCEPT_ZONE_Treshold&NoSPlit.png
   :alt: The minimum threshold and the option not splitted work 
   
   The minimum threshold and the option not splitted work
   
When this value is set, the activity will only be scheduled on the day that the daily availability will be greater than or equal to this threshold.

You also have the option to add a new property to a "can not be split" task.

This will require defining the minimum work to be allocated each day and thus filling in the minimum threshold field

planning will require finding consecutive days with at least the given value possible.

.. warning:: Do not take into account the "real" work.

.. _scheduling-priority:

Scheduling priority
-------------------

The scheduling priority allows to define scheduled order among planning elements.

Possible values: from 1 (highest priority) to 999 (lowest priority).

Scheduling priority value is set in progress section of planning element.

.. note::

   If projects have different priorities, all elements of project with highest priority are scheduled first.


Project structure
-----------------

Work breakdown structure (WBS) is used to define project structure.

Breakdown can be done with sub-projects, activities and test sessions.

.. rubric:: Structure management

* As seen previously, the project can be split in subprojects.
* All other planning elements concerned by the project or subproject are put under them without structure.
* Planning elements can be grouped and orderly in hierarchical form.
* Structure management can be done in the Gantt chart or in planning elements screen.

.. rubric:: WBS element numbering

* The project is numbered by its id number.
* All other elements are numbered depending on their level and sequence.
* WBS numbering is automatically adjusted.

Project scheduling calculation
------------------------------

The project schedule is calculated on the full project plan that includes parents and predecessor elements (dependencies).

.. rubric:: Scheduling

The calculation is executed task by task in the following order:

 #. Dependencies (Predecessor tasks are calculated first)
 #. Prioritized planning elements 
 #. Project priority
 #. Task priority
 #. Project structure (WBS)


.. rubric:: Constraints

The remaining work (left) on tasks will be distributed on the following days from starting planning date, taking into account several constraints:

* Resource availability
* Resource capacity
    
  * Project allocation capacity (Project allocation rate)
  * Assignation capacity (Task assignation rate)

* Planning mode


.. rubric:: Resource overloads

* This is not possible to overloading the resources. 
* The planning calculation process respects availability and capacity of the resource. 
* If it is not possible to distribute remaining work, on already planned days, the calculation process uses new available time slot.

Resource function and cost
**************************

.. rubric:: Function

The function defines the generic competency of a resource.

It is used to define the role play by the resource on tasks.

In real work allocation screen, the function name will be displayed in the real work entry.

The :ref:`function` screen allows to manage function list.

.. rubric:: Resource cost definition

Allows to define the daily cost, according to the functions of the resource. 

The daily cost is defined for a specific period.

.. rubric:: Real cost calculation

When real work is entered, the real cost is calculated with work of the day and daily cost for this period. 

.. rubric:: Planned cost calculation

When the project planning is calculated, resource cost is used to calculate planned cost.

Planned cost is calculated with planned work of the day and current daily cost. 

.. note::
 
   Function and cost are defined in :ref:`resource` screen.
