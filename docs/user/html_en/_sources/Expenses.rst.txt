Budget
------
* A budget is a list of all products and different expenses to plan.
 
* It is a plan that allows to define in advance the expenses, the incomes and the possible savings to be realized during a definite period.

* It allows to anticipate the resources that the company will have at a specific moment.

* You can create as much budget and sub budget as you want.

* An expense is related to a base budget, ie a budget item

* A budget item is linked to a parent budget 

* in the same way as the project selector, you can filter, thanks to the "Budget Parent" filter, a budget and "his family" on the list poster.


.. note:: 

   **The parent budget**

   * The parent budget exists only to consolidate budget line items
   * You can't change spending in the Progress field of a parent budget 
   * Only the target amount can be changed

   **The budget item**

   * The budget items are the finer element of the budget analysis. 
   * These posts or budget destinations will allow you to detail your budget, categorizing it at your convenience.
