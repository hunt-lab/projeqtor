   Action
   
     Stocks are used in anticipation of risk. They serve to reduce the risks.

     The analysis of these risks consists in defining actions. There are two types of actions:

       * Preventive action aimed at removing the risk or
       * Corrective action that has been earned on the occurrence of a risk

   Activity
   
      An Activity can be likened to the key stages of the project: it is the skeleton of your project that organizes the main phases of a project
         
         * They have a start and end date
         * They designed for the planning phases of a project 
         * They serve to organize the milestones and tasks of a project
         * They can allocated to a or many resources
         * They can be prioritized and have sub-activities
   
   Administrator

      An administrator is a :term:`user` with "Administrator" profile.
      Has a visibility over all the projects.
   
         
   AGILE
   
      Agile methods are groups of practices of piloting and realization of projects.
      They originate from the Agile manifesto, written in 2001, which uses the term 'agile' to refer to multiple existing methods
   
   Closed

      Closed is a micro state in ProjeQtOr
   
      * Flag to indicate that item is archived.
      * Item will not appear in lists any more

   CRON
      
      cron is a program that allows users of Unix systems to automatically execute scripts, 
      commands or software at a date and time specified in advance, or according to a cycle defined in advance.

   Decision
   
      A good decision helps move towards the end goal. 
      It is in the general interest, the interest of the greatest number as well as in the interest of the project
      
      a good decision is a suitable solution, put in place with the tools and resources available at a given moment.
      
   Description

    * This field allows to define a description on an item.  
    * Depending on the element type, name of field can be different.

    .. seealso:: **GUI behavior**

       * It is possible to define that description field is mandatory.
       * The element type screens allow to set this parameter to several elements. 
       * More detail, see: :ref:`behavior-section`.

   Gantt chart
   
      Description  The Gantt chart is a tool used in scheduling and project management 
      and allowing to visualize in time the various tasks composing a project. 
      
      It is a representation of a connected graph, evaluated and oriented, 
      which makes it possible to graphically represent the progress of the project 
   
   Handled

    * Flag to indicate that item has been taken into account.
    * Date of handling is saved.
    * This generally means that responsible has been named.

   Id

    * Every item has a unique Id, automatically generated on creation.
    * Id is chronologically allocated, for all kind of items (Activity, Ticket).
    * Id is shared for all projects and all types (i.e. incident) of the same kind items (i.e. Ticket).

   Incident
   
      Any event that is not part of the standard operation of a service and that causes, 
      or may cause, an interruption or decrease in the quality of that service   

   Issuer

      An issuer is a :term:`user` who created the item.

      .. seealso:: **Creation information**

         The issuer name and creation date of an item are displayed in the :ref:`Creation information zone<detail-window>`.
   
   Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
   
      Indispensable to the project manager, an indicator makes it possible to evaluate a situation and to make an adapted decision. 
      Key performance indicators measure the performance of your projects. 
      You choose them together with your team. They must be simple, reliable, easily understandable by all and relevant
   
      If the indicator is green, all is well, you will need to continue the actions in progress to maintain this good result.  
      If the indicator is red, then you must take the necessary corrective action.   
      If the indicator is orange, it should be monitored.   
            
         * Each indicator is associated with a specific goal.  
         * An indicator necessarily implies a decision.
         * An indicator is never silent.  
         * A relevant indicator must be simple
         
   Objective
   
      An objective is a goal to achieve by carrying out different tasks. For example, building a new plant in order to produce more and meet the growing demand. It is essential to precisely define the goal (s) to reach so that you and your team know where you are going. 
      A good goal must be :term:`SMART`.   
 
   Origin

    * Determines the element of origin.
    * The origin is used to keep track of events (ex.: order from quote, action from meeting).
    * More detail, see : :ref:`Origin field<origin-field>`.

   Owner builder 
   
      The client is the person on whose behalf the work is carried out. It is the sponsor and the one who bears the financial cost. 
      The client is a natural or legal person, public law or private law

   PERT chart (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)
   
      provides a practical method and means to describe, represent, analyze and logically follow the tasks and the network of tasks to be carried out as part of an action to be undertaken or to be followed.
      The PERT diagram represents the work schedule by a dependency graph. 
      His network formalism focuses on the interconnection of the tasks to be performed and the calculation of critical paths. 
      
      An important difference with the Gantt chart is the conventional time scale of the PERT chart which represents a sequence of tasks 
      and not durations or a calendar
   
   Project
   
      A project is defined as a finite set of activities and actions undertaken in order to meet a defined need within a set timeframe 
      and within the limits of an allocated budget envelope

      * Reference is displayed after id, automatically generated on creation. 
      * Reference depends on defined format, see under "Format for reference numbering" section in :ref:`global_parameters` screen.
      * Default format defines a specific numbering format that can provide unique numbering sequence for each project and/or each type of items.

   Requestor

      A requestor is a :term:`contact`.
      Used to specify the requestor for ticket, activity and requirement.
      Only contacts allocated to the selected project can be a requestor.  

   Responsible

    A responsible is a :term:`resource` in charge of item treatment. 
    Usually, the responsible is set when the status of the item is :term:`handled<Handled status>`.
    Only resources allocated to the selected project can be a responsible.  

    .. seealso:: 

       **GUI behavior**
    
         It is possible to define that responsible field is mandatory on handled status.
   
         The element type screens allow to set this parameter to several elements.

       The element type screens allow to set this parameter to several elements.
   
   Risks
   
      The risk is a hazard, an undesirable event whose appearance is not certain, 
      resulting in the possibility that the project does not achieve the objectives of: 
      
         * Completion date
         * Costs
         * Specifications (techniques, quality, performance , reliability ...) 
         * Others: Image of the company, environment, legal, social ...

      The risk can put in danger the project, deviations from forecasts the making it unacceptable or totally unacceptable.
      We distinguished the risks exogenous (external at now ; suppliers, evolution regulation, political, social, meteorology...)
   
   Quality 
   
      The Quality approach consists in finding the match between the answer to the needs of the project, 
      the correct expression of these needs by adequate specifications which go through a careful listening of the customer, 
      and a realization answering the expression of the needs.

   User

    * User allows to connect to the application.
    * User profile define general access rights. But it does not necessarily give access to project data.
    * Users management is performed on the :ref:`user` screen.
   
   SMART
   
       it is an acronym or mnemonic device that stands for 'Specific, Measurable, Acceptable, Realistic and Temporally Defined'.
       These terms apply mainly to the determination of the most suitable objectives in order to complete a given project. 
       Setting appropriate targets will help accelerate project completion and improve its chances of success.
   
   Status

    * The status determines the life cycle of items.
    * It defines the progress of the treatment of the item.
    * Item is linked to a element type, element type is linked to a workflow.
    * A workflow defines the possibility to go from one status to another one, more detail, see: :ref:`workflow`.

    .. seealso::

   WBS

    * Work Breakdown Structure.
    * Hierarchical position of the element in the global planning.
    * WBS also defines the index of an item in the WBS structure. This index is calculated like paragraphs in a word document.
   
   
   
   Work 
   
      * Assigned : The work initially planned for this resource to the task.

      * Left:  [Left work] = [Assigned Work] – [Real Work]
               Project leaders can adjust this value to estimate the work needed to complete the task by the resource.
               
      * Planned: Date defined by ProjeQtOr
            
      * Real: Sum of work done by this resource to the task. 

      * reassessed: [Reassessed work] = [Real Work] + [Left Work]

      * Requested: Initially requested by the customer
         
      * Validated: Initial planning, on which we committed each other. Baseline.
      
   .. warning:: the planning does not take into account the validated charge but the assigned one
