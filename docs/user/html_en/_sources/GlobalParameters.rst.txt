   :alt: Connexion screen with the protocol SSO
   
   With the single sign on you do not go through the login screen of projeqtor but by a screen dedicated to single sign-on

When connected to the SSO service, the service tells each application that the user is logged on. 

This avoids having to connect to applications one by one.

In concrete terms, the site or service to which the user is trying to connect makes a request to the server or the identity provider's site. This one asks if the user is connected. If so, he transmits the information.

Depending on the protocol used, the two sites exchange keys, signatures and / or other information to verify the identity of the user.
