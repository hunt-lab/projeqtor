Gantt chart
***********

The Gantt chart is a tool used in scheduling and project management and allowing to visualize in time the various tasks composing a project.

It is a representation of a connected graph, evaluated and oriented, which makes it possible to graphically represent the progress of the project

This chapter offers many features that will be described in the next sections

.. index:: Gantt chart (Planning)

Planning
========

This screen allows to define projects planning and follow progress.

The critical path of your project is the longest sequence of tasks that must be completed for the project to be completed by the due date.

* click on the **critical path** check box to calculate and display the red path in the Gantt schedule.

.. warning:: Project tasks that are not traversed by the critical path are elements that will not affect the duration of the project and, 
   even if modified, will not result in a modification of this duration on the entire project

   Dependencies dialog box

**3 dependency types are managed:**

|iconES| **End-Start:** The second activity can not start before the end of the first activity.

|iconSS| **Start-Start:** the successor can not begin before the beginning of the predecessor. Anyway, the successor can begin after the beginning of the predecessor.

|iconEE| **End-End:** The successor should not end after the end of the predecessor, which leads to planning "as late as possible". Anyway, the successor can end before the predecessor. Note that the successor "should" not end after the end of predecessor, but in some cases this will not be respected:

  * if the resource is already 100% used until the end of the successor
  * if the successor has another predecessor of type "End-Start" or "Start-Start" and the remaining time is not enough to complete the task
  * if the delay from the planning start date does not allow to complete the task
 
.. note:: **Update Pop-up**

     Right click on a dependency link (when its color is orange) will show update pop-up
     
     You can modify the delay, add a comment or remove the dependency.

.. note:: **Graphical add dependency**

     You can easily add a dependency with drag and drop from predecessor bar to successor bar
     
     These dependencies are always End-Start, but you can change their type afterwards

   This new feature is technically complex and it is not compatible with all browsers.
   
   Compatible with the latest versions of IE (v11), Firefox, Edge and Chrome.
   
   Else, the old export feature will be used.

.. seealso:: 

   **Forced feature activation/deactivation**

   To enable this feature for all browsers, add the parameter **$pdfPlanningBeta='true';** in parameters.php file.
   
   To disable if for all browsers (including Chrome), add the parameter **$pdfPlanningBeta='false';**
