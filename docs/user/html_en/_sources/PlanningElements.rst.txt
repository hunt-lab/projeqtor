An activity is a kind of task that must be planned, or that regroups other activities.

An activity can be:

* Planned tasks.
* Change requests.
* Phases.
* Deliveries.
* Versions or releases.

.. rubric:: Assigned resources

.. rubric:: Real work allocation

* For a resource, assigned activities are tasks in which he can entry the real work.

.. rubric:: Activities regroupment

* Activities can have parents to regroup activities. 
* So a WBS (work breakdown structure number) is calculated for the activities.
* Activities can be sorted inside their parent activity, on the Gantt planning view, using drag and drop.
* Parent activity must belong to the same project.

.. rubric:: Work on tickets

* Tickets can be linked to an activity (task).
* Work on tickets will be included in the activity.
* More detail, see: :ref:`ticket` screen.

 .. compound:: **Assignment of resources to task**

    * The assignment will be automatically created once that resource has entered the working time (real work) in the ticket.
    * The assigned task and the sum of working time entries by resource in tickets will be available in its timesheet.

.. rubric:: Fix planning 

* When box “fix planning” is checked, the activity scheduling won’t be remade.
* This will avoid change on planned values.

A milestone is a flag in the planning, to point out key dates.

Milestones are commonly used to check delivery dates.

They can also be used to highlight the transition from one phase to the next.

ProjeQtOr offers two types of milestone:

 .. compound:: **Floating milestone**

    * This milestone will automatically move to take into account dependencies.

 .. compound:: **Fixed milestone**

    * This milestone is fixed in the planning, not taking into account predecessor dependencies.
    * This kind of milestone is interesting, for instance to set-up start date for some tasks.
    * Fixed date is set by validated date.

.. rubric:: Monitoring indicator

* The indicators can be defined on the progress data.
* See: :ref:`progress-section-monitor-indicator`
