Requirements
------------

.. sidebar:: Concepts 

   * :ref:`product-concept`

Requirement is a rule defined for a project or a product.

In most IT projects, requirement can be a functional rule for a software.

It allows to define and monitor cost and delays.

It can be linked to test cases, it's used to describe how you will test that a given requirement.

.. rubric:: Rights management

* Linking requirements to a project will limit the visibility, respecting rights management at project level.

.. rubric:: Requirement link to test cases

* Test cases can be linked to a requirement in **linked element section**.
* Linking a requirement to a test case will display a summary of test case run (defined in test session).
* This way, you will have an instant display of test coverage for the requirement.

.. rubric:: Requirement link to tickets

* When test case run status is set to **failed**, the reference to a ticket must be defined (reference to the incident).
* When the requirement is linked to a test case with this run status, ticket is automatically linked to the requirement. 

.. rubric:: Predecessor and successor elements

* Requirements can have predecessors and successors.
* This defines some dependencies on the requirements.
* The dependencies don’t have specific effects. It is just an information.

.. rubric:: Monitoring indicator

* Possibility to define indicators to follow the respect of dates values.

  .. describe:: Respect of initial due date

  .. describe:: Respect of planned due date
