Real work allocation
--------------------

As ProjeQtOr implements Effort Driven planning (work drives planning calcuation), 
one of the key to manage project progress is to enter the real work 
and re-estimate left work for all ongoing tasks.

ProjeQtOr provides a dedicate screen for this feature, to ease this input so that entering real work is as quick as possible.
