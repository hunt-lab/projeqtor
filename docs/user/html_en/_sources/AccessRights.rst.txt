Profiles

The profile is an entitlement group, each with specific access rights to the database.

So, each user is linked to a profile which defines the data they can see and possibly manage.

.. rubric:: Value of Field "Name"

* The value of field "Name" is not the name displayed, but it is a code in the translation table. 
* The name displayed at right of the field is the translated name.

when the new profile is created, it appears in the list of existing profiles in the list box.
It remains between square brackets because it does not exist in :ref:`translatable-name`.

   The value of field "Name" must be a significant name and must not contain spaces or special characters.

The restriction zone offers two types of restriction.
One by type based on ProjeQtOr elements (actions, activities, invoices, catalog ...) 
and the other based on the restriction of product versions

The name displayed at right of the field is the translated name.

.. rubric:: How to modify the translation file?

* You can edit  file "lang.js" to add translation of new value or to modify the existing value translation.
* Or, you can download Excel file named "lang.xls", available on ProjeQtOr site. You can modify the translation tables of all languages and produce  files "lang.js".
