   Progress section
   
This section allows all at once, define planning and follow-up the progress.

All planning elements have a progress section.

Description of the different sections is grouped by the planning elements that have common fields and behavior.

Progress data are displayed in the same format, **but according to the planning element, fields can have another meaning or behavior.**

The following sections displayed first a general description of progress data.

Next, description of fields and information in sections will be displayed.

.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. _progress-section-column-def:

General description
===================

Below is the definition of the different columns that make up the Progress section.

.. rubric:: Column "Requested"

Requested dates allows to define initial dates (wished dates).

Useful to define preliminary dates in a project, in a change request or other.

Requested dates can be used:

   * as a first draft of planned dates.
   * with indicators to monitor the respect of start and end dates.

.. rubric:: Column "Validated"

Validated data are used by project leader to define committed dates,  work and cost expected.

Validated data can be used:

  * to fix a limit or a target and for some planning mode they are used to define parameter entries.
  * with indicators to monitor the respect of start and end dates, work and cost expected.
  * like the project's baseline.

.. note:: 
 
   **Validated end date (due date)**

    * The validated end date allows to fix a due date at which the work must be completed.
    * If the work is planned or completed beyond this limit, the error field will be highlighted.
    * For task and milestone, their Gantt element will be red. (See: :ref:`gantt-chart-view`)

.. rubric:: Column "Planned"

* Planned dates are the estimated time to complete tasks or the estimated end date of milestones.
* Planned dates are the estimated duration to complete tasks by resources according to assigned work.
* Planned dates can be used to initialize validated and requested dates. (See: :ref:`project-planning`)
 
.. rubric:: Column "Assigned"

This column displays the planned work and cost of resources and the planned project expenses.

Assigned work is the planned work assigned to resources for completing tasks

 .. compound:: **Planned work and cost of resources**

    * Scheduled work time assigned to a resource for completing a task.
    * The estimated cost is the scheduled work time assigned to a resource for completing a task multiplied by its current daily cost.

 .. compound:: **Planned project expenses**

    * Sum of the planned amount of all project expenses.

.. rubric:: Column "Real"

This column displays the duration, completion date, work done and cost incurred by resources and the project expenses.

 .. compound:: **Dates**

    * Allows to determine when a planning element has really begun and completed. 

 .. compound:: **Work done and cost incurred by resources**

    * Work done by a resource on an assigned task.
    * Work done are entered by resources, on a daily basis by real work allocation screen. 
    * The cost incurred is the work done by a resource on a task on daily base multiplied by its daily cost defined for the period.

 .. compound:: **Project expenses**

    * Sum of the real amount of all project expenses.

.. rubric:: Column "Left"

This column displays the remaining of planned work and planned amount.

By default : Left = Assigned - Real

Left work should be re-estimated by the resource.

 .. compound:: **Work and cost remaining of resources**

    * Scheduled work time assigned to resources for completing tasks minus the work done.
    * The remaining cost is the remaining work by a resource on a task multiplied by the latest daily cost defined for it.

 .. compound:: **Project expense**
 
    * Sum of the planned amount of project expenses not incurred yet.

.. rubric:: Column "Reassessed"

This column displays the resources work reassess and the spending projection.

Always calculated as [Reassessed] = [Real] + [Left] 

  

.. rubric:: **Work and cost consolidation**

Work and cost from tasks (Activity, Test session and Meeting) are summarized for each parent element.
         
Allows to follow-up progress on grouped tasks like phase, delivery, test group, sub-project and project. 
       
.. _progress-section-consolidation:
         
.. rubric:: **Consolidate validated work and cost**

Consolidation can be done on validated work and cost.
         
Allows to calculate the scheduled work and budgeted cost from lower planning elements.
         
The calculation depends on consolidation method selected and on which level the validated values are entered.


          .. compound:: **Consolidation method "Never"**

            * Values are not consolidated.

          .. compound:: **Consolidation method "Always"**

            * Values on the lower levels are consolidate up to project level.
            * Will overwrite existing values

          .. compound:: **Consolidation method "Only if set"**

            * Zero values at lower levels do not overwrite values on upper level
            * non-zero values on the lower level are consolidated up to project level.

.. compound:: Recurring (on a weekly basis)
  
This new mode allows reserving availability on recurring tasks on a weekly basis, for example 1/2 day every Monday, 1h every day, ... 
    
    Activities in this mode dynamically assign the work based on the start and end bounds:
    
       * start defined with a dependence End-Start or Start-Start
       * end defined with an end-end dependency. This is the first planning mode in ProjeQtOr that defines activities whose assigned work is not fixed, but adapts to the duration of the project.


.. rubric:: Fixed duration

* The task is planned by duration.
* The task is “floating” depending on predecessors.
* The validated duration field must be set.
* It is not necessary to assign resources to the task.
* If work is assigned to the task, planning behavior is the same as "Regular between dates" but with floating task. 

.. note::

   If you want fixed duration with fixed start, use "Regular between dates", or use milestone to define start.
