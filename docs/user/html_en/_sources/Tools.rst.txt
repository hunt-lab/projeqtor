Import data
-----------

Imports data from CSV or XLSX files.


.. rubric:: How to do

1. Select the element type from the list.
2. Select file format (CSV or XLSX).
3. Select the file.
4. Click on **Import data** button to start importing.

.. rubric:: Report of the import

* Data that is not imported because not recognized as a field appear in grey text in the result table.
* Data that are voluntarily not imported (because must be calculated) appear in blue text in the result table.

.. note:: Import users

   * The password field must be cut and pasted from the database because it is encrypted.
   * If you enter some readable password, the users will not be able to connect.

.. attention:: 

   * If you want to create new users **don't put any id** because if id already exists, it will be overridden by the new (with possibility to erase admin user…).
   * Always keep in mind that your import may have some impact on administrator user.
   * So be sure to keep an operational admin access.


.. note:: Importing document versions

    * Two ways to import document versions:       
        - by describing only the version, with its standard fields.    
        - by describing the document and the version (the name of the fields of the version will be followed by '(DocumentVersion)', or its translation into the current language).

.. note:: CSV import 
    
    * The CSV import file may also include :  
        - 'importFile' field that will give the link to the version file (this file will have to be reachable by the PHP server).
        - 'target' field that can be set to 'DELETE' (the file to be imported is deleted after import) or a directory name (the file to be imported is moved to this directory after import) or nothing (the file to be imported is not modified).
    
    
.. raw:: latex

    \newpage


.. _file-format:

File format
"""""""""""

The content of the imported file must fit the element type description.

To know the data that may be imported, click on the |buttonIconHelp| button.

.. rubric:: Names of columns 

* The first line of the file must contain the name of the fields.

.. note::

   * Names of columns can contain spaces (to have better readability).
   * The spaces will be removed to get the name of the column.

.. hint:: 
   
   * Look into the model class. The names are the same.

.. rubric:: Date format

* Dates are expected in format “YYYY-MM-DD”.

Data import process
"""""""""""""""""""

Operations are performed, depending on whether the element type, the column or the column value.

.. rubric:: Column Id 

You may or may not add an "id" column in the file.

 .. compound:: **Column "id" exists and "id" is set in a line** 

    * The import will try to update the corresponding element, and will fail if it does not exist.

 .. compound:: **Column "id" does not exist or if "id" is not set in a line**

    * The import will create a new element from the data.  

.. rubric:: Linked tables

For columns corresponding to linked tables ("idXxxx"), you can indicate as the column name  either "idXxxx“ or “Xxxx" (without "id") or the caption of the column (as displayed on screens).

 .. compound:: **Numeric value**

    * If the value of the column is numeric, it is considered as the code of the item.

 .. compound:: **Non numeric value**

    * If the value of the column contains non numeric value, it is considered as the name of the item, and the code will be searched for the name. 

.. rubric:: **Columns with no data**

* In any case, columns with no data will not be updated.
* Then you can update only one field on an element.

.. rubric:: **Clear data**

* To clear a data, enter the value "NULL" (not case sensitive).


.. rubric:: Planning elements

* Insertion into "Planning" elements (activity, project), automatically inserts an element in the table “PlanningElement”.
* The data of this table can be inserted into the import file.

.. rubric:: Tickets

* Do not import the value of "real work" on tickets, even if it is specified in the import file.


.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. index:: Import data (Automatic)

Automatic import
""""""""""""""""

.. figure:: /images/GUI/ADMIN_ZONE_AutoImport.png
   :alt: Automatic import of files
   
Imports can be automated.

Files placed on a defined directory will automatically be imported.

.. note:: 

   * Automatic import parameters must be set in :ref:`Global parameters<automatic-import>` screen.
   * Background task must be started by :ref:`admin-console` screen.


------------
 
The files must respect some basic rules.  

.. rubric:: File name format

* File name format is : "Class"_"Timestamp"."ext"
* Example of import file name: Ticket_20131231_235959.csv

 .. compound:: **Class**

    * The type of item to be imported (Ticket, Activity, Question, …).

 .. compound:: **Timestamp**

    * Timestamp defined to be able to store several files in the directory.
    * Format is free.
    * The recommended format is “YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS”.

 .. compound:: **Ext**

    * File extension, representing its format.
    * Valid extensions are CSV and XLSX.

.. rubric:: File format

* The files must follow the ProjeQtOr :ref:`file-format`.
* Files must be full and consistent.

   .. hint::

      * The files should not be directly created in the import folder.
      * They must be created in a temporary folder and moved afterwards. 

--------------

.. rubric:: Import process

* Correctly imported files are moved to a “done” sub folder of the import folder.
* If an error occurs during import of a file, the full file is moved to “error” sub-folder of the import folder, even if there is only one error over many other items correctly integrated.
* You can get the result as a log file and/or email summary.

 .. compound:: Rights management

   Definition of profiles that have the right to create a simulation.
   
 .. compound:: Sequencing of the creation of simulations

   This is the setting for taking creation requests into account.
   
   * **Fixed frequency**
   
     Analyzes creation requests at regular intervals and starts the generation of simulation environment as soon as a request is encountered.
   
   * **At a given time**
   
     to program night creations for example
     
     "Immediate" requests may take some time if multiple simulation requests are generated simultaneously.  
  
  
 .. compound:: Definition and management of boundaries

   You can limit the number of total simulations per profiles.
   
      This limitation can have some advantages:
      
      * avoid saturating the server.
      * force users to clean up their files.
      * limit performance degradation caused by the creation of a simulated environment

   If the limits are reached, the request screen to create a simulated environment will be blocked and the reason explained.

This screen allows you to manage your queries for new simulation environments, to follow them or to request the deletion of a particular simulation.

You can also track requests from other users based on your profiles and your rights.


 .. compound:: Generating a simulation environment

   To request the creation of a new simulation area, click on |buttonAdd|
   
   A pop up will appear allowing you to make your request.

   The dates of availability of the simulation spaces are indicated when your request is taken into account.
   
   
 .. compound:: Color code
   
   * **Blue:** Request being created
   * **Orange:** Warning (delete request)
   * **Red:** Error creating the environment (path, rights ...)

 .. compound:: Go to the cloned Environment
   
   When your simulation is ready, green status, you can open your cloned environment.
   Click on |iconGoto| to launch the environment.
   
   A new tab opens with a new ProjeQtOr session. Authenticate yourself, you can start working in your environment.

   The instance area turns red when you are in a simulation space.
   
   Not all screens or functions will be accessible in this space. 
   
   For example, you will not be able to request and create a new simulation space in your cloned environment.   
     
     
 .. compound:: Copy a cloned Environment
   
You did a successful simulation on one of your cloned environment. 

You want the copy to run other tests but without touching the simulation.

Just copy this environment.

The origin of the copy will then be indicated in the list with a shortcut to access it.

   
 .. compound:: Copying datas
   
   It is necessary to copy the code and the data because the simulations created in a version could no longer be compatible with the code of the main instance that has migrated.

   The creation of a simulation instance is a heavy process for the server: duplication of code, duplication of data...
   
   That's why when generating your simulation space, not all data is copied.
   
  
      **Is not copied**
      
           * Archived data (closed)
           * Update history
           * Attached documents and files
      
      **Copy of the code** 
      
      Disabling all automation and notifications
      
      Update the simulations table to record the actual creation:
      
           * Date and time of actual creation,
           * Flag "available environment"
           * Instance access URL 


 .. compound:: Deleting a simulation environment

   Request to delete a simulated environment:
   
   The delete request is available on the simulation list
   
   Delete requests are stored in the simulations table
   
   Deletes are processed in the same process as creatives but before creatives to free up space before allocating new resources to new instances

      **Deleting process:**
      
      * Deleting data
      * Deleting the code
      * Update the simulations table to record the effective deletion:
      
           * Date and time of the effective deletion,
           * Update of the "available environment" flag   

.. tip::

   To avoid problems of management of the rights too broad and invasion of the server, all the simulations (code) will be placed in a directory "simulation" of the principal repertoire of ProjeQtOr.

   Thus, if the main instance is accessible via the url "projeqtor.dga.fr" the simulations will be accessible via the url "projeqtor.dga.fr/simulation/name_de_simulation".

.. warning:: 

   The CRON program must be started and running so that the simulation request can be taken into account and can be generated.
